# Magento 2 Threshold Taxes

### Add support for applying tax rates based on order subtotal. 

NOTE: This extension is currently untested in production, use at your own risk.

This extension allows you to set "from" and "to" subtotal ranges for applying tax rates. 

Issue reports are welcome but note that I may not have time to fix them in a reasonable amount of time. 
If you are not a developer and want to modify the extension please EMPLOY a developer to do this :-)

# Other Remarks

- Thresholds are only applied for cart total collection at this time and are not applied for catalog prices. 
  However it would be easy to make this addition and even add a setting for it.
  
- It's only been tested using tax-exclusive catalog prices. Updates may be required to support tax-inclusive prices.
